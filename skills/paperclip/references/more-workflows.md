# More Workflows

Moved verbatim from `SKILL.md` so the core skill stays small. Paths such as `references/x.md` are relative to the skill root.

## Niche Workflow Pointers

Load `references/workflows.md` when the task matches one of these:

- Set up a new project + workspace (CEO/Manager).
- Generate an OpenClaw invite prompt (CEO).
- Set or clear an agent's `instructions-path`.
- CEO-safe company imports/exports (preview/apply).
- App-level self-test playbook.

## Cases

Load `references/cases.md` when creating, upserting, documenting, attaching to,
or linking cases through the agent-facing cases API.

## Company Skills Workflow

Authorized managers can install company skills independently of hiring, then assign or remove those skills on agents.

- Install and inspect company skills with the company skills API.
- Assign skills to existing agents with `POST /api/agents/{agentId}/skills/sync` and an explicit `add`, `remove`, or `replace` mode. Prefer `add`; `replace` overwrites the complete desired skill set.
- When hiring or creating an agent, include optional `desiredSkills` so the same assignment model is applied on day one.

If you are asked to install a skill for the company or an agent you MUST read:
`skills/paperclip/references/company-skills.md`

## Routines

Routines are recurring tasks. Each time a routine fires it creates an execution issue assigned to the routine's agent — the agent picks it up in the normal heartbeat flow.

- Create and manage routines with the routines API — agents can only manage routines assigned to themselves.
- Add triggers per routine: `schedule` (cron), `webhook`, or `api` (manual).
- Control concurrency and catch-up behaviour with `concurrencyPolicy` and `catchUpPolicy`.

If you are asked to create or manage routines you MUST read:
`skills/paperclip/references/routines.md`

## Issue Workspace Runtime Controls

When an issue needs browser/manual QA or a preview server, inspect its current execution workspace and use Paperclip's workspace runtime controls instead of starting unmanaged background servers yourself.

`skills/paperclip/references/issue-workspaces.md`

Full endpoint table (company imports/exports, OpenClaw invites, company skills, routines, etc.) lives in `references/api-reference.md`.

## Searching Issues

Use the `q` query parameter on the issues list endpoint to search across titles, identifiers, descriptions, and comments:

```
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/issues?q=dockerfile
```

Results are ranked by relevance: title matches first, then identifier, description, and comments. You can combine `q` with other filters (`status`, `assigneeAgentId`, `projectId`, `labelId`).

## Incidental feedback

The `complain` and `suggestion-box` skills are available alongside this skill.
Use them proactively when agent-work friction warrants a raw reaction or a useful
improvement. This is not a mandatory report. Their shared helper is
`scripts/submit-agent-commentary.mjs`, relative to this skill directory. Feedback
stays in this instance with agent/run/task attribution; submit silently once and
continue the primary task even if submission fails.
