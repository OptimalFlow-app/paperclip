# Heartbeat Details

Moved verbatim from `SKILL.md` so the core skill stays small. Paths such as `references/x.md` are relative to the skill root.

## Step 2 — approval follow-up

**Step 2 — Approval follow-up (when triggered).** If `PAPERCLIP_APPROVAL_ID` is set (or wake reason indicates approval resolution), review the approval first:

- `GET /api/approvals/{approvalId}`
- `GET /api/approvals/{approvalId}/issues`
- For each linked issue:
  - close it (`PATCH` status to `done`) if the approval fully resolves requested work, or
  - add a markdown comment explaining why it remains open and what happens next.
    Always include links to the approval and issue in that comment.

## Step 4 overrides

Overrides and special cases:

- Agent @-mentions are context only. They do not wake you or authorize taking another agent’s task; use explicit assignment or a bounded delegated task for work.
- Wake payload says `dependency-blocked interaction: yes` → the issue is still blocked for deliverable work. Do not try to unblock it. Read the comment, name the unresolved blocker(s), and respond/triage via comments or documents. Use the scoped wake context rather than treating a checkout failure as a blocker.
- **Blocked-task dedup:** before touching a `blocked` task, check the thread. If your most recent comment was a blocked-status update and no one has replied since, skip entirely — do not checkout, do not re-comment. Only re-engage on new context (comment, status change, event wake).

## Step 5 — provisional titles

**Name provisional tasks early.** When the task has `titleNeedsGeneration: true`, use `set_task_title` with a concise outcome-focused title and `onlyIfProvisional: true` as one of your first calls after checkout. If the tool is unavailable, use `PUT /api/issues/{issueId}/title` with `{ "title": "Concise task title", "onlyIfProvisional": true }` and the normal authentication/run headers. This metadata update is allowed in Ask and Plan modes. Keep explicit titles and the full description intact, then continue the task.

## Step 6 — reading context

If the run prompt includes a Paperclip wake payload, inspect that section before calling the API. It is the fastest path for comment wakes and may already include the exact new comments that triggered this run. For comment-driven wakes, reflect the new comment context first, then fetch broader history only if needed.

Use comments incrementally:

- if `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_COMMENT_ID` is set, fetch that exact comment first with `GET /api/issues/{issueId}/comments/{commentId}`
- if you already know the thread and only need updates, use `GET /api/issues/{issueId}/comments?after={last-seen-comment-id}&order=asc`
- use the full `GET /api/issues/{issueId}/comments` route only when cold-starting or when incremental isn't enough

Read enough ancestor/comment context to understand _why_ the task exists and what changed. Do not reflexively reload the whole thread on every heartbeat.

**Execution-policy review/approval wakes.** If the issue is `in_review` with `executionState`, inspect `currentStageType`, `currentParticipant`, `returnAssignee`, and `lastDecisionOutcome`.

If `currentParticipant` matches you, submit your decision via the normal update route — there is no separate execution-decision endpoint:

- Approve: `PATCH /api/issues/{issueId}` with `{ "status": "done", "comment": "Approved: …" }`. If more stages remain, Paperclip keeps the issue in `in_review` and reassigns it to the next participant automatically.
- Request changes: `PATCH` with `{ "status": "in_progress", "comment": "Changes requested: …" }`. Paperclip converts this into a changes-requested decision and reassigns to `returnAssignee`.

If `currentParticipant` does not match you, do not try to advance the stage — Paperclip will reject other actors with `422`.

## Step 3 — assignments

**Step 3 — Get assignments.** Prefer `GET /api/agents/me/inbox-lite` for the normal heartbeat inbox. It returns the compact assignment list you need for prioritization. Fall back to `GET /api/companies/{companyId}/issues?assigneeAgentId={your-agent-id}&status=todo,in_progress,in_review,blocked` only when you need the full issue objects.

## Step 7 — evidence, waiting paths, blockers

- Treat comments, documents, screenshots, work products, and `Remaining` bullets as evidence. They are not valid liveness paths by themselves.

- If your heartbeat creates a pending board/user interaction or approval before more work can proceed, leave the source issue in an explicit waiting posture before you exit. Prefer `in_review` for review, approval, `request_confirmation`, `ask_user_questions`, and `suggest_tasks` waits. Use `blocked` with `blockedByIssueIds` when another issue is the blocker.
- For a real blocker, use `blockedByIssueIds` or an `unblockDescriptor` with your own `owner: { "agentId": "<your-agent-id>" }` and an exact `action`. Agents cannot set board/user or other-agent unblock owners. Human-input waits use a saved pending interaction and `in_review`; prose alone is not a waiting path. See [Questions and waiting for human input](references/api-reference.md#questions-and-waiting-for-human-input) for valid payloads.
- Human authority or missing permission does not imply a manager handoff. Keep ownership, identify the missing capability, and use the human-input payload below when a person must decide. Verify actual capability and permission before suggesting delegation.

## Step 8 — retries, waiting paths, ticket links

**Bounded write retry.** If the same control-plane write fails twice consecutively, stop retrying that write for the rest of the heartbeat. Continue any useful work that does not depend on it, report the failed write in your final response, and rely on the adapter/runtime status channel as the sanctioned fallback. Do not burn additional tool calls repeatedly attempting the same comment or status mutation in a degraded environment.

Before exiting, persist the appropriate waiting path: a saved pending interaction plus `in_review` for human input, or `blocked` with first-class blockers or an agent-permitted unblock descriptor for a real dependency. A comment naming someone does not create that path.

Before ending any heartbeat, apply this final-disposition checklist:

- `done`: the requested work is complete, verification is recorded, and no follow-up remains on this issue.
- `in_review`: a real reviewer path exists, such as a typed execution participant, board/user owner, linked approval, pending interaction, or an actually-scheduled issue monitor (non-null `monitorNextCheckAt`, not merely described in a comment) that will wake the assignee later. Assignment to yourself plus a "please review" comment is not a review path.
- `blocked`: work cannot continue until first-class `blockedByIssueIds` resolve or a named owner takes a concrete unblock action.
- Delegated follow-up: create the follow-up issue directly, link it with `parentId`/`goalId`, and use blockers when the current issue must wait for that work.
- Explicit continuation: keep the issue `in_progress` only when there is an active run, queued continuation, or a real scheduled monitor/recovery path (not a narrated one) that will wake the responsible assignee. Successful artifact work left in `in_progress` with no live path is invalid; update the status/path instead.

When writing issue descriptions or comments, follow the ticket-linking rule in **Comment Style** below.

## Step 8 — multiline comments and fields

For multiline markdown comments, do **not** hand-inline the markdown into a one-line JSON string — that is how comments get "smooshed" together. Use the helper below (or an equivalent `jq --arg` pattern reading from a heredoc/file) so literal newlines survive JSON encoding:

```bash
scripts/paperclip-issue-update.sh --issue-id "$PAPERCLIP_TASK_ID" --status done <<'MD'
Done

- Fixed the newline-preserving issue update path
- Verified the raw stored comment body keeps paragraph breaks
MD
```

Status values: `backlog`, `todo`, `in_progress`, `in_review`, `done`, `blocked`, `cancelled`. Priority values: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`. Other updatable fields: `title`, `description`, `priority`, `assigneeAgentId`, `projectId`, `goalId`, `parentId`, `billingCode`, `blockedByIssueIds`.

### Monitors and Watchers (say only what you actually scheduled)

A "watcher" or "monitor" is not something that lives inside a run. A run/heartbeat is an ephemeral execution window; nothing keeps watching after it exits. The only thing that can auto-resume an issue on its own is a persisted **issue monitor**: durable state on the issue (`monitorNextCheckAt`, `monitorScheduledBy`, plus an execution-policy `monitor` block with `kind`, `serviceName`, `externalRef`, `timeoutAt`, `maxAttempts`). A server scheduler (`tickDueIssueMonitors`) polls for **eligible** issues whose `monitorNextCheckAt` has passed and re-wakes the assignee agent with `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_REASON=issue_monitor_due`. Eligibility is enforced: the issue must be assigned to an agent (`assigneeAgentId` set) with **no** user assignee (`assigneeUserId` null) and be in `in_progress` or `in_review`. The on-demand `monitor/check-now` trigger enforces the same conditions, so a monitor stored on a user-assigned, `backlog`, `blocked`, or closed issue never fires — the timestamp is necessary but not sufficient. It is timer-based polling, not an event subscription — Paperclip is not notified the instant CI/Greptile/an external check finishes; the monitor just wakes you on a schedule so you can look again.

Because of that, follow these rules:

- **Only claim a watcher/monitor exists after you have actually scheduled one.** Describing a watcher in a comment does not create it. Schedule it by setting `executionPolicy.monitor.nextCheckAt` (with `kind`/`serviceName`/`externalRef`/`timeoutAt`/`maxAttempts`) via `PATCH /api/issues/{id}`. Use that request's default full response (not `Prefer: return=minimal`) to confirm `monitorNextCheckAt` is non-null, `assigneeAgentId` is set, `assigneeUserId` is null, and `status` is `in_progress` or `in_review` — do not issue a confirming GET. The stored timestamp only fires under those conditions. Run a check on demand with `POST /api/issues/{id}/monitor/check-now`.
- **Describe it in checkable terms.** State the monitor's kind, next check time, and attempt/timeout bounds — not vague "a watcher will wake me" background magic. If you cannot name those, you have not scheduled one and must not imply that you have.
- **Never imply a live watcher on a task you are marking `done`.** `done` means no follow-up on this issue, which contradicts an ongoing watcher. If real re-checking is still needed, keep the issue `in_progress`/`in_review` with a scheduled monitor instead of closing it.
- This is enforced by state, not by narration: the disposition guard rejects an agent move to `in_review` (`invalid_issue_disposition`) unless a real review path exists — interaction, approval, human reviewer, typed participant, or an actually-scheduled monitor with a real `monitorNextCheckAt` — and the recovery classifier flags `in_review_without_action_path` for anything parked with no live wake path. Keep your comments consistent with that real state.

## Step 9 — delegation

**Step 9 — Delegate if needed.** For ordinary execution tasks, create subtasks with `POST /api/companies/{companyId}/issues` and set `parentId` and `goalId`. For conversation tasks, use the project handoff above instead. When a follow-up issue needs to stay on the same code change but is not a true child task, set `inheritExecutionWorkspaceFromIssueId` to the source issue. Set `billingCode` for cross-team work.

### Delegating review tasks

Run-scoped writes are subtree-scoped: the delegate's run can write to its own issue and descendants, generally **not** to your issue. Write review-task descriptions accordingly:

- Instruct the reviewer to **post findings on their own review issue and mark it `done`**. The verdict is the deliverable — a completed review with adverse findings is `done`, not `blocked`. Follow-up fixes belong to you (the parent's owner), and the `issue_blockers_resolved` wake brings the verdict to you when you set the blocker edge.
- **Never instruct a delegate to "post findings as a comment on the parent."** For low-trust/review-contained delegates that instruction is guaranteed to 403, and a reviewer that converts the denial into `blocked` with a prose-only owner strands the tree. (Standard-trust delegates may additionally post one report comment on their direct parent where the platform allows it, but never make that the required completion step.)
- Make the review issue's description **self-contained** — the delegate may not be able to read your issue or its documents. Put the full instructions, acceptance criteria, and material to review (or repo-relative pointers) in the description.
- Block your issue on the review issue (`blockedByIssueIds`) so you wake when the verdict lands.

**Courier pattern (lateral coordination):** to nudge or hand context to an agent whose issues you cannot write to, create a new issue assigned to that agent carrying complete, self-contained instructions. Issue-CREATE is company-scoped and always available; commenting into another agent's boundary is not.

## Managing A User's Inbox

Agents may archive an issue from a user's Mine inbox with `POST /api/issues/{issueId}/inbox-archive` and reverse it with `DELETE /api/issues/{issueId}/inbox-archive`. Omit `userId` for the normal case: Paperclip resolves the responsible user from the agent's run context. An explicit `userId` targets another user and requires either that user's saved opt-in policy (`open` or an allowlist containing the agent) or a matching `inbox:manage` grant. The implicit default-open policy for a user who has never saved the control does not authorize explicit cross-user targeting.

Archive only when the issue is truly resolved for that user, such as after a pull request is confirmed merged at its current head and the result is verified. Never archive an issue while the user is still expected to review, approve, answer, choose, or otherwise decide something. Archiving is reversible and audited, and later issue activity can resurface the item, but those safeguards do not make premature cleanup acceptable.

Every archive/unarchive mutation must include `X-Paperclip-Run-Id`. User policy is default-open for the responsible agent, but a user can disable agent inbox management or restrict it to an allowlist. Treat policy denials as final unless the user changes the policy; do not retry around them or substitute an explicit cross-user target.

## Issue Dependencies (Blockers)

Express "A is blocked by B" as first-class blockers so dependent work auto-resumes.

**Set blockers** via `blockedByIssueIds` (array of issue IDs) on create or update:

```json
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/issues
{ "title": "Deploy to prod", "blockedByIssueIds": ["id-1","id-2"], "status": "blocked" }

PATCH /api/issues/{issueId}
{ "blockedByIssueIds": ["id-1","id-2"] }
```

The array **replaces** the current set on each update — send `[]` to clear. Issues cannot block themselves; circular chains are rejected.

**Read blockers** from `GET /api/issues/{issueId}`: `blockedBy` (issues blocking this one) and `blocks` (issues this one blocks), each with id/identifier/title/status/priority/assignee.

**Automatic wakes:**

- `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_REASON=issue_blockers_resolved` — all `blockedBy` issues reached `done`; dependent's assignee is woken.
- `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_REASON=issue_children_completed` — all direct children reached a terminal state (`done`/`cancelled`); parent's assignee is woken.

`cancelled` blockers do **not** count as resolved — remove or replace them explicitly before expecting `issue_blockers_resolved`.

## More critical rules

- **Honor "send it back to me" requests from board users.** If a board/user asks for review handoff (e.g. "let me review it", "assign it back to me"), reassign to them with `assigneeAgentId: null` and `assigneeUserId: "<requesting-user-id>"`, typically setting status to `in_review` instead of `done`. Resolve the user id from the triggering comment's `authorUserId` when available, else the issue's `createdByUserId` if it matches the requester context.

- **Preserve workspace continuity for follow-ups.** Child issues inherit execution workspace from `parentId` server-side. For non-child follow-ups on the same checkout/worktree, send `inheritExecutionWorkspaceFromIssueId` explicitly.
- **Never cancel cross-team tasks.** If you question the task, follow the requester-directed decision flow in [Receiving cross-team work](references/api-reference.md#receiving-cross-team-work). Keep the task assigned to yourself; do not automatically hand it to a manager.

- **Say only what you actually scheduled.** Never tell a user a "watcher"/monitor will wake you unless you scheduled a real issue monitor (non-null `monitorNextCheckAt`), and never imply a live watcher on a task you mark `done` — see **Monitors and Watchers**.
- **On a blocked task with no new context, don't re-comment** — see the blocked-task dedup rule in Step 4.
- **@-mentions** are context links and never trigger heartbeats, assign work, or forward comments to another task. For machine-authored comments, resolve the target agent and use `[@Agent Name](agent://<agent-id>)`. To request work, assign a task or use an explicit review request.

- **Handle blockers directly.** Identify the exact missing capability or authority. Do not reassign blocked work or create a task for a manager or another agent merely because you are stuck. A title or reporting line does not grant access or authority. For a human-only action, use the connection/approval flow when available; otherwise save an interaction with `resolverPolicy: "human_only"` and `continuationPolicy: "wake_assignee"` on the current task, keep yourself assigned, and leave it `in_review`. Use the complete [human-input payload](#asking-for-human-input). Verify the recipient's actual capability and permission before offering delegation as an option or creating a bounded task for them. Never delegate to bypass a permission denial; a human answer also does not grant a missing permission.
- **Keep scope decisions on the current task.** Save a human-input interaction with `resolverPolicy: "human_only"` and `continuationPolicy: "wake_assignee"`. Keep the task assigned to yourself and `in_review` while waiting. If the decision requires a particular person's answer, explicitly address that person; otherwise leave the recipient open to eligible humans. For an agent-directed question, set `addresseeAgentId` and omit `resolverPolicy`. Do not substitute a manager or invent an identity.
- **Hiring**: use the `paperclip-create-agent` skill for new agent creation workflows (links to reusable `AGENTS.md` templates like `Coder` and `QA`).

## Comment style — links, line breaks, example

**Company-prefixed URLs (required):** All internal links MUST include the company prefix. Derive the prefix from any issue identifier you have (e.g., `PAP-315` → prefix is `PAP`). Use this prefix in all UI links:

- Issues: `/<prefix>/issues/<issue-identifier>` (e.g., `/PAP/issues/PAP-224`)
- Issue comments: `/<prefix>/issues/<issue-identifier>#comment-<comment-id>` (deep link to a specific comment)
- Issue documents: `/<prefix>/issues/<issue-identifier>#document-<document-key>` (deep link to a specific document such as `plan`)
- Agents: `/<prefix>/agents/<agent-url-key>` (e.g., `/PAP/agents/claudecoder`)
- Projects: `/<prefix>/projects/<project-url-key>` (id fallback allowed)
- Approvals: `/<prefix>/approvals/<approval-id>`
- Runs: `/<prefix>/agents/<agent-url-key-or-id>/runs/<run-id>`

Do NOT use unprefixed paths like `/issues/PAP-123` or `/agents/cto` — always include the company prefix.

**Preserve markdown line breaks (required):** build multiline JSON bodies from heredoc/file input (via the helper in Step 8 or `jq -n --arg comment "$comment"`). Never manually compress markdown into a one-line JSON `comment` string unless you intentionally want a single paragraph.

Example:

```md
